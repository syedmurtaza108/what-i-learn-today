Contains my daily learning that I want to share with you😃

# Flutter

# Flutter code compilation
**Develop**

(1) JIT + VM (**Mobile & Desktop**)
 - JIT compiler converts program source code into native machine code just before program execution.
 - “Just-in-Time” means making “only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the amount needed.”
 - The file generated by JIT needs VM to run

(2) `dartdevc` (**Web**)
- Dart code transpiled into js code

**DEPLOY**

(1) AOT + runtime (**Mobile & Desktop**)
 - The AOT compiler works by compiling your code before it is “delivered” to whatever runtime environment runs the code. To generate AOT snapshot

	 ```dart2native bin/main.dart -k aot```

 - AOT generates single binary file that can run natively

(2) `dart2js` (**Web**)
